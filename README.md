# Calories-Burnt-Prediction
Use of Linear Regression, lasso regression, PCA and XGBoost models to predict the calories burnt and comparison of the performance of the given models in terms of R2 score and MSE.

It is hence shown how XGBoost performs much better (as seen by MSE value) as it has better balance between bias and variance, can handle missing values internally and can handle noisy data better.
